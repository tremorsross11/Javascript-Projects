# Javascript-Projects
A repository for my Java script code
The Javascript folder contains simple functions that I created to be put on websites.
The Jquery folder contains a webpage where I practiced using Jquery.
The React-projects and basic-Javascript folders contain websites that have functions that uses React.
The To-do folder is my To-Do app I made with more complex Javascript code.
